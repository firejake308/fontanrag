- so we have 29,294 notes so far. The rest are still decompressing
- there's an Excel sheet with some patient characteristics like name, MRN, DOB, CURRENT AGE
- let's start by making a SQLite database
    - or alternatively, we could use the JSON and add fields
    - let's think about which would be slower, ALTER COLUMN, or writing JSON
    - yeah SQL is faster for sure
- okay, so now I have the inital db
- next, I want to add the time that each note was created
- it looks like each note has at the bottom the time that it was signed or addended
    - and it follows a strict template, so we shouldn't need an LLM for this
    - but we can use it to test our pipeline for adding a column to the db
